Best friends must walk a fine line between stopping their friend from making big bad decisions and encouraging them to make small bad decisions that are a lot of fun. And no one does it better than my partner in crime. Friends are like family that we get to choose. I’m glad I made such a good choice! Happy birthday to my adventure buddy. I hope this coming year will be filled with many more fun adventures together! Friendships are like trees. You must water them for them to grow. So, let’s order some drinks! You’ll be my best friend forever! …… Because you already know too much. Here’s to all the inside jokes, all the stupid things we’ve done together, all the memories we’ve shared. May the years to come be filled with many more. I probably wouldn’t fight a tiger for you or a lion. But I would definitely shoo a cat that was giving you the stink eye! Happy birthday to the friend that I would do almost anything for. Thank you for accepting me for who I am and always encouraging me to be the person I should be. Thanks for being weird with me. You are the best! If you ever kill someone, call me first. I’ll help you get rid of the body. That’s your birthday present my friend, one free body disposal. The second time it happens, I’ll have to charge. There are a lot of people who know a lot of my stories. But you were there to help me create all those great stories! Happy birthday to my best friend. We are getting older, but we still have fun. In fact, we’ll probably be up to same shenanigans when we are in an old folks home together! Time can change a lot but it will never change how much I care for you, my best friend. Happy birthday to my best friend and part time therapist. Thanks for always listening to my problems and trying to help! Hey, you’re weird. But it’s okay because I’m weird too. I’m so glad we get to be weird together. Your problems are my problems. And I celebrate your successes like they were my own. I’ve always got your back. No matter what. Thank you for always helping me live life to the fullest. I couldn’t ask for a better friend than you! I don’t care about having lots of friends. I only care about have great friends. Like you! I’ve seen you at your best and I’ve seen you at your darkest. And I still think you are one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met. Happy birthday to the person who always says yes to my crazy ideas! My life wouldn’t be nearly as fun without my best friend in it! I’ve got lots of friends who make me laugh, but only you make me laugh so hard I snort. I’m so lucky to have you as my best friend. I hope your birthday is as fun as you are! Thank you for always being there to save me from my dumb mistakes. I almost feel bad how many times you bailed me out. But because you are so thoughtful, you make just as many dumb mistakes as I do so I can bail you out and don’t have to feel bad! Hey I just wanted to you to know that whenever you have a crazy idea, my only question will be: “What time?” You make the most boring activities fun, you make the most serious situations hilarious, you make my world a better place. My best friend has the most amazing, wonderful, humble, and all around just fantastic best friend! Happy birthday from your best friend! For your birthday, here is my promise to you. If you yell Marco and I’m in earshot, I will always yell Polo. Because that’s what best friends do. As long as you are my friend, you’ll never have to do silly stuff alone. Have a wonderful birthday and if you do anything ridiculous I’ll be right next to you doing the same thing. I know I’m not always a perfect friend. But I’ll always be a loyal friend. I hope your birthday is as amazing as you are. Whenever we hang out I feel like I’m home. Thank you for being such an amazing friend all these years. When we became friends, you didn’t know what you were getting into. But now that we are best friends you are stuck with me. Mwhahahaha… I mean happy birthday! Sure, no one else finds our antics amusing. But we do and that’s what is important! Happy birthday to my partner in crime. Life’s a road and I’m glad to have you next to me on the journey. Through thick and thin, let’s get to our destination together. It’s your birthday. Let’s do something stupid together. I’d follow you through hell and back. But after we get done with that, I get to plan the next road trip. Happy birthday to my best and craziest friend. Having lots of friends is great, but life just wouldn’t be the same without a best friend to share everything with. Thank you for being the such an amazing friend. If they made a movie about our friendship, I’m not sure if anyone would watch it. But it would be my new favorite movie. Happy birthday to my best friend, you’ll always be a movie star in my eyes! No matter how long we are apart, when we get back to together it’s always just like old times. I don’t know how you put up with me, but I’m so glad you do! When things are bad, let me know I’ll try to make them better. When things are going great, let me know I’ll celebrate with you. Middle of the night or middle of the day, I’ll always be there for you. It’s my best friends’ birthday! Let’s make some fun mistakes! I love it how we finish each other’s…. So, for your birthday I just want to say…. If you decided to become a hermit and live out in the middle of nowhere, I’d still visit you. Probably not often, but I’d come, and I’d bring booze. Friends are the people who do all the weird things that you thought no one else did. Thanks for being weird like me. Happy birthday! It’s hard to shop for a birthday present for someone who has everything. I mean you already have the best gift of all, a great best friend! It’s your birthday, let’s get you all liquored up so you’ll do something embarrassing I can tease you about it later! Isn’t that what best friends are for? We are different in a lot of ways, but that’s what makes us such good friends. Puzzle pieces need to be different to fit together! Happy birthday to my favorite corner piece. When it comes to friends, like Al Capone said, it’s better to have four quarters than a hundred pennies. Happy birthday to my favorite quarter! If you could rate friends, I’d only give you 1 star. That way I could have you all to myself! Happy birthday from the only best friend you’re allowed to have. Great friends are like jeans. When you find one that fits perfectly, keep them forever. Happy birthday to the greatest friend, I hope I don’t ever wear you out! Friends come and go, but best friends are the ones who stick around. I look forward to celebrating many more birthdays with you! To my best friend, I hope for all the fun and happiness you could ask for on your birthday and for the days to come! I know this past year was a rough one. But I’m sure the coming year will be your best yet! Happy birthday, this is the year that everything will go right, I can feel it! My best friend deserves the best birthday. But I don’t have the funds for the best birthday ever, but just know you deserve it! Did you know in some countries it’s customary for the person having the birthday to pay for all the drinks? Good thing you don’t live there. Drinks are on me tonight! Happy birthday to my amazing, cool, hilarious, best friend. There’s no one else I would rather spend the day with! Hey, thanks for being you. You are one of a kind and my best friend.

But it’s your birthday, so I will. You are the best! Happy birthday to the friend who makes my family question my sexuality.

Happy Birthday to someone I think about almost as much as I think about myself. The best way to remember your wife’s birthday is to forget once.

I haven’t brought any cake for you. Because I know you love this bottle of champagne more. I searched a long time to find the perfect birthday message for you, but just ended up with this. Best friends are so awesome. Well, at least yours is. Happy Birthday. God made us best friends because he knew our parents couldn’t handle us as sisters.

We are just like fat thighs, we always stick together. Congratulations.You are my favourite. And by favourite, I mean I hate you the least out of everyone. I love you & your resting bitch face.

I am so grateful for the day you were born. Thanks for being born. It’s a great excuse for us to get together and get drunk. I’m pretty sure we’re more than best friends. We’re like a really small gang. I hope we are friends until we die. Then I hope we stay ghost friends and walk through walls and scare the shit out of people. Keep calm and remember I love you. Being friends as long as we have, people have started to say we look like alike. I can think of no greater compliment than to be called your sister, that’s for sure.

You make my heart race without doing a thing. I love your hugs and kisses. You complete me. I love you, forever and always. Loving you is as natural as breathing. I never knew what love was until I met you. If I could rewrite the alphabet, I would put U and I together. Thank you for taking such good care of my heart without knowing anything about cardiology. Falling in love with you is the second best thing in the world because finding you was the first. It’s big, it’s warm, and it’s fuzzy. Before you get any ideas – it’s a big HUG from me to you! FYI: I love my man. Do you love me? A: Yes B: A C: B I love you more than I did yesterday but not more than I will tomorrow.

Happy Birthday to someone silly, spontaneous, beautiful, and witty! I love you to the moon and back! Happy Birthday to my favourite sister. We are sisters by chance, friends by choice.

Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday to Mum and Dad’s second favourite kid. Happy Birthday to my favourite brother… okay, you’re my only brother, but if I had others, you’d still be my favourite. They say you can choose your friends but not your family. I just want you to know that if we weren’t already brothers, I would choose to be friends with you in a heartbeat! I’m so lucky to have a brother like you! Happy Birthday! I should call you Broogle because you help me solve all the problems to which I can’t find answers in Google. Happy Birthday Bro. How could I forget all the times we got into trouble when we were growing up together? Or all the creative ways you helped me get out of trouble? Happy Birthday, bro, from your ‘partner in crime.’ Happy Birthday, Brother! Always know that if you fall… I will be the first one there to laugh at you! Other kids look up to Superman, Batman and Spider-Man. I don’t need to look at a man flying in the sky, a capped crusader zipping along the streets or a guy jumping from one building to another. I just look up to you, my brother. Happy birthday to my superhero. The best thing mum and dad have done is to give me a brother like you. Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! You smell like a donkey and you look like one too! Just kidding. You’re not an ass… all the time. Love, Your Favorite Sister Thank you for my great childhood memories. Here’s to many more memories to come. Happy Birthday to the world’s greatest brother! Birthdays are like chocolate. It’s best not to keep count of how many you have, and just enjoy them instead. Happy Birthday to the sweetest mother I know. I’m not only celebrating your birth today. I’m celebrating my own luck in being born to such a great mother.

Welcome to the fun decade. 30-year-old people are usually wise, stable, and responsible. Here’s to you making some positive changes as you get a little bit older. Happy Birthday! It’s about time you start acting your age. Thirty is a good start. You are not 30. You are just a 20-year-old guy with 10 years of experience. Happy Birthday. Congratulations on turning 29 years old again for the second time. I’m looking forward to celebrating your 29th for many years to come. Here’s to maturing like a fine wine. Happy 30th Birthday! “The only time you really live fully is from thirty to sixty. The young are slaves to dreams; the old servants of regrets. Only the middle-aged have all their five senses in the keeping of their wits.” — Hervey Allen Life is a book and your forties are the chapters when it all starts making sense. Wishing you an amazing 40th birthday! Life’s milestones are not supposed to be counted, they’re supposed to be celebrated. Happy Birthday! Wishing you a very Happy 40th Birthday. Enjoy your forties—they’re just like your twenties, but twice as good! May your 40th birthday be an awesome mix of love, friendship, and happy memories! Wishing you a very Happy Birthday. Finally 40! Now your life begins! Here’s to being older and wiser than you once were, and giving all the best advice to young ‘uns who won’t listen. Happy 40th Birthday! Spring chicken or not, you’re still the most fabulous hen I know! Here’s to having the energy of a pup, the senses of a deer, and the wisdom of an owl. Happy 40th Birthday! Wishing you a very warm welcome to the middle ages. Happy 40th Birthday! Forty is when you will finally realise why your mum and dad were so cranky when you were growing up. Happy Birthday. Strive to be a 40-year-old that makes people go – ‘I wanna be like that when I turn forty.’ Happy Birthday. Remember how excited you are when you turn 5 years old? You should be 10 times that excited. Happy 50th Birthday! You are half a century, or 5 decades, or 50 years, or 600 months, or 2,609 weeks, or 18,262 days, or 438,288 hours, or 26,297280 minutes, or 1,577,836,800 seconds old, depending on what unit of measure you are using. Hey, at least I didn’t figure it out for seconds. Happy 50th Birthday! The best way to enjoy life is to forget your age and just remember the memories. Happy Birthday. If you take all the experience and judgment of men over fifty out of the world, there wouldn’t be enough left to run it. Don’t let age dampen your youthful spirit. Life is a blessing, every day and every minute. Don’t be afraid of the wrinkles on your face. Every line is symbolic of one of your life’s phase. Happy 50th Birthday. By the time we hit fifty, we have learned our hardest lessons. We have found out that only a few things are really important. We have learned to take life seriously, but never ourselves. I hope that any remaining lessons are fun! A man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life. You look 21, feel 18, and act 11. That makes you 50! There are numerous advantages in being fifty. Just ask any eighty-year-old! You’re no longer the oldest person I know in their 40’s. Now you’re the youngest 50-year-old I know. You’re not getting older… just more distinguished! Happy 60th Birthday. At 60, you have the combined wisdom of 6 10-year-olds, the intelligence of 3 20-year-olds, the wit of 2 30-year-olds, and the memory of 60 1-year-olds. Happy 60th Birthday. Hope you continue to live life to the fullest — in good spirits, good health and good times. Congratulations on turning 60. Now you can wear anything you want, and no one will care. You leave everyone in awe. At 60, you have more going on in your life than most people have in a whole lifetime. You’re an inspiration to me and everyone who knows you! You leave us all wondering… what’s next for this fascinating person!?! You are awesome!! Happy 60th Birthday! As we look back in your life, we realize that you have earned the most important things – the love of your family and the respect of your friends. Happy 60th Birthday. Some may think of 60 as getting older, but it’s actually an amazing time in a person’s life where they can take stock of who they are and celebrate each new day with a renewed sense of self! Live life to the fullest! Happy Birthday! You’re 60 years old? You’re 6 perfect 10s! Happy Birthday. It’s not that 60-year-old people are lazy: by 60, they’re masters at efficiency. Every wrinkle has its story. You must have a lot of stories to tell. Happy 60th Birthday filled with lot of happiness and joy! May your rocking chair always rock our world, may your walking stick always show us the right path, and may your spectacles always teach us to see right from wrong. Happy 70th Birthday! Age can never catch up with a person who has already won the race of life. Happy 70th Birthday. To be 70 years young is far more cheerful and hopeful than to be 40 years old. Happy 70th Birthday! You deserve all the accolades you’re getting and more. You’ve worn so many hats for so many people, for so long — without expecting anything in return. It’s time you did! At 70, there are two rules for making your birthday unforgettable: Rule 1: Have the time of your life. Rule 2: Don’t forget Rule 1. Dream passionately as if you are in your youth, execute responsibly as if you are middle-aged and advice generously as if you are a seventy-year-old. Happy 70th! I can only hope to be half-the person you are at 70 when I turn 35! Happy 70th Birthday. One of the reasons why I love our family is that someone like you is part of it. Happy Birthday, Grandpa! Whether you turn seventy or eighty, no matter how old you get, you will always be the hero dad who lifted his little daughter on his shoulder every time she tugged at his pants. I love you dad, Happy 70th Birthday. You may have turned seventy, but your spirit makes you look twenty. Age is just a number in your life’s story, your soul will forever remain youthful and infectiously happy. Happy 70th Birthday.
