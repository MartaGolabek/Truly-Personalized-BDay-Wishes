"In this life, there are too many adventures and so little time to enjoy all of them. Not for you. You have always jumped in; head first, with so much fire and grit. Life’s an endless adventure with you beside me. Happy Birthday to a champion."
On this day of happiness and joy, I’d like to wish you a lifetime full of success, because a person as amazing as you, deserves all of their dreams to come true. Happy Birthday!
I look forward to spending every birthday with you because you are a bundle of joy. Every single day, you amaze me at your ability to make the sun shine through every cloud. You deserve a big celebration, and I’m making it happen.
This is a day of celebration not only because of your special day. It is also the day we give thanks for having you in our lives. You are a blessing.
"A celebration isn’t complete without some reflection and introspection. Take the time to look behind you; the clues to your future are in there."
Only you can determine how old you indeed are. So go ahead, wear that purple hat with the red dress if you must. Scale a mountain and glide over a cliff if you seek adventure. It’s your life – own it.
