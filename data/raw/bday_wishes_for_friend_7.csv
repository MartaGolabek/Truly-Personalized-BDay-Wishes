Wishing you a brainy birthday! Ample years and yet another year, you have still not grown wiser.
It is your birthday, dear. You cannot stop anyone from having your favorite items for food right in front of you.
Eat as much as you can because God has kept your birthday as a fat-free special day for you.
Happy birthday, my friend! I hope you blow all candles yourself or I would be calling the local department for fire services this year!
You have become another year old. Good luck on that! Just make sure you try not to forget your car keys.
You know my capability to remember all the historical years with accurate dates during our history classes? Well, your birth date was not of course, so I did not remember. Belated birthday wishes sprinkled with a sorry kept in the dungeon!
Too many birthdays could mean you are closer to death. You had one just last year. Please stay safe because it is scientifically proven. Love you anyway!
Happy birthday, buddy. I truly hope you get to enjoy cake without any tooth.
This is to my best friend wishing her a best birthday. You must be happy and feel good because you look like you are 20 but you are 30 today.
You have gotten a year older today but I won’t remind you of that. You can eat my piece of cake.
On this birthday, I promise not to reveal your age number to any, but then you should probably blow those numbers 2 and 8 on your cake.
It is awesome to be in the youth stage and full of energy and active. Do you even remember how it used to feel like?
I hope your laziness doesn’t show up while blowing the candles because I don’t want to blow your candles again.
It is another year to your life. There must another part of your body that aches now.
Just imagine what you would love to listen on your birthday, what kind of gifts you would like that you will cherish it forever. Assume I did them all to you and stay happy! Happy birthday, dear!
I made some cake for your birthday this year. It is going to be tasty and just like you want it. But then, unfortunately, I could not find a place to light enough candles. Then I remembered, oh! Your age.
Birthdays are the days nature says us to have more portion of cakes. So move, let me eat your birthday cake. Oh, your portion too!
Let us get to reality. It gets older but never better! Wishing you a good birthday! Did I remind you? You are an exception, though.
Today, I give you permission to illuminate candles on your favorite cake – your birthday one. You don’t have to worry, I have already informed the fire service department in this area.
Congratulations on this one more year of survival through your math class. You got this!
We all know that wisdom comes with age but then, I see no signs of aging in you at all. Happy birthday, dear best friend!
Do not worry about the number of candles. Your age is just described by your behavior and it is totally worth it.
If you’ve made it past the driving age, the drinking age, and the lowering of car insurance age — you might be wondering what you have left to look forward too. The answer is birthday greetings like this one.
Now, doing the math with the number of candles on your cake, you would be requiring the lungs of the legendary Hercules to blow all these candles by yourself. No, I did not mean you are old and fat! I meant I’m your best friend and I’d help you.
This day makes you feel like the one like you are chosen. Maybe you are..chosen..to stay away from the cake slices. I remember it is your birthday!
Today is the day you realize you are old because your candles cost more than your cake.
I wish you take a real oath to do some exercise and wish you don’t walk up the stairs and call it exercise.
Happy birthday to the most beautiful woman I have seen until now. And that is only because today is your birthday and I don’t use mirrors.
You look different today. That could be your charm that increased, your weight that decreased and the hairstyle you recently change. But no! then, I realize – you have just become a year older.
For your birthday, I tried thinking of words like superb, impressive, awesome, stunning, and gorgeous. But anyway, I know I do not cost anything to think. So I quit! Happy birthday, you!
I would wish you for all of your dreams to come true! But then, it will be a tough shot on me to find out a wish for you next year. Since you are going to be certainly alive and healthy for another year, let me just say Happy Birthday!
Your birthday is such a special occasion that I wish I could wrap myself up and give myself to you as a gift.
Every one of your birthdays is a special once in a lifetime experience, but I always wake up the next day too drunk to remember them.
Many happy returns! May you receive one extra year added to your life for every pound you gain.
On the day you were born, if your mother had set you adrift in a basket to escape the wrath of pharaoh, it would have sunk from the excessive weight.
You possess the qualities of a President – the looks of George Bush, the intelligence of Barack Obama and the disciple of Bill Clinton – so let me use the occasion of your birthday to wish that you make the most of out our your life!
On your birthday, to ensure you have many more, I’ve gotten you a designated driver. Cheers!
For your Big Day, they should just create a cake with a liquor bottle inside.
May you grow old and rich, so that you can leave me a big inheritance.
I love you so much that if I had a job I would have bought you a gift.
May this gift serve as an eternal reminder of our friendship because it’ll probably be the last one I ever buy.
Happy birthday, my dear. May your bank account grow so fast that you get audited by the IRS.
On your special day, may you be blessed with the problems of the rich – such as where to park your yacht.
May your body grow so old that people mistake you for a piece of wood. Birthday greetings, best friend!
Happy birthday to my beloved friend. I couldn’t have asked the casting director of life to give me a better sidekick.
May life compensate you like Floyd Mayweather for the many battles you have fought.
I thought about moving out of your house as you continue to grow old, but by the looks of things, you probably need me now more than ever.
If life were a sports league you would be MVP. Happy birthday and many more, dear friend.
Buddy, even though you were born with no exceptional talent, marketable skill or extraordinary intelligence, I still believe that life has nothing but the best in store for you.
Every day that I go to the gym, I use you as an inspiration – of what I would become if I let myself slack off. Best birthday wishes, best bud!
You are such a special person that when you’re about to die I hope they freeze your brain so that it can be implanted in a robot a thousand years from now.
As men, it’s not appropriate for us to shed tears when exchanging gifts on special occasions, but the one I’m giving you today cost me so much that I have to cry.
We could use the occasion of your birthday to party our fat asses off like we always do. However, this year I want you to use this time to reflect on the finer things in life, and when I return from the club you can tell me all about them.
As you grow older and wiser, may you also become senile and forget about the money I’m owing you.
Today would have been the perfect occasion to write sweet words about the greatest, most spectacular, uniquely exquisite friend in the world, but I already finished my autobiography a month ago.
If life were a game of soccer, I would be the multi-million dollar striker and you would be the faithful water boy I wave to at the end of every big game. Wish you the best, sweet friend!
Wrapping myself up and gifting myself to you as a birthday present would make me seem vain, so I decided to present you with my life-sized portrait instead.
As you grow into manhood, may life bless you with children who love you just as much as you love making them!
Life without you is like a sitcom with no laugh track. Happy birthday, my beloved buddy.
May you age with the wisdom and strength of a Chinese kung-fu master.
You’re a shining example of what it means to still enjoy life even when logic dictates that you’re too old to.
In these coming years, may life bless you with so much prosperity that everything you touch turns to gold. May life also bless you with the grace to leave me, your best friend, all of your possessions once you die from starvation.
On this great day, may God bless you with booze made of water from the fountain of youth so that you’ll never age. Have a great one.
May an extra day be added to your life for every strand of hair that falls from your head.
Last year when I wished you old age, I didn’t know it would happen so fast! Forgive me.
Sometimes people say I must be gay for having a best friend who is also a female, but they don’t know you the way I do.
Best wishes! May you grow so old that all of your best friends are replaced by robots.
As the years progress, I learn each day to appreciate the simple things more and more, which is why we’re closer now than ever before.
If Thanksgiving is symbolized by turkeys and Easter by rabbits, then the official animal of your birthday should be the tortoise. Happy birthday, my extremely old fart of a friend!
It’s your birthday, eat the first and the last slice of cake just because you can!
Look on the bright side today. This is the youngest you’ll ever be again!
I would just like to point out that I knew today was your birthday before Facebook told me.
I hope your day is filled with cake, dancing, and having the attention on you. You know, things that normally happen. But this time, you get to do all of those things while wearing a silly party hat. Enjoy!
Birthday cards get lost and junked but a text message is forever!
To celebrate, let’s hit up all the places we can get free dessert and birthday songs! When else can you have groups of strangers sing to you without it being awkward?

I thought of getting a unique and charming birthday gift to you, but then what popped up in my mind is that you have me in your life already.
You must be feeling proud of yourself this birthday. A year after, a smarter and a beautiful friend you have. Oh, it is me.
Oh, it is your birthday, the day I always wait to celebrate! Have that piece of cake with you and get that champagne for your best friend.
