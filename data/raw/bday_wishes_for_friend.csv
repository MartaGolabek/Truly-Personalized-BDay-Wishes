To me a birthday means celebrating the presence of an individual in our lives.
May your birthday be full of happy hours and special moments to remember for a long long time!
Today is the oldest you have been, and the youngest you will ever be. Make the most of it!
Wisdom doesn’t necessarily come with age. Sometimes age just shows up all by itself.
May the dream that means most to you, start coming true this year. Happy Bday!
The great thing about getting older is that you don’t lose all the other ages you’ve been.

Today you have added another candle of knowledge and wisdom to your life. May it give you the power to enlighten the whole world. On your birthday, I wish you joy and happiness.
Don’t regret another birthday, the good news is that you are alive and can celebrate it.
You know you are getting old when the candles cost more than the cake.
Life seems to fade our memory, so on this birthday I will forget yours if you forget mine!
When a man has a birthday, he takes a day off. When a woman has a birthday, she takes at least three years off.
All the world is a birthday cake, so take a piece, but not too much.
The secret of staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age.
Last week the candle factory burned down. Everyone just stood around and sang Happy Birthday.
The older you get the better you get, unless you are a banana.
When the candles on your cake burn down before they are all lit you know you are getting up there.
Aging seems to be the only available way to live a long life.
Birthdays are a great time to stop an appreciate gravity. Sure, it makes things sag as you get older, but it also keeps your cake from flying all over the room, so you don’t have to chase it.
Happy birthday to a person that’s charming, talented, and witty, and reminds me a lot of myself.
May your birthday mark the beginning of a wonderful period of time in your life!
Let us celebrate the occasion with wine and sweet words.
My dear friend, may your special day be full of beautiful, magical and unforgettable moments!
Happy birthday, friend. May your day be as beautiful as you.” –Unknow

May the love of family surround, the enthusiasm of friends be with you, and the joy of another year to look forward be foremost in your thoughts on this day of your birthday.
