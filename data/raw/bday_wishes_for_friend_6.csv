Cute: I love you more than I love pizza.Funny: Birthdays are nature’s way of telling us to eat more cake.30th: 30 is 3 perfect 10s. Happy 30th.
Forget about the past, you can’t change it. Forget about the future you can’t predict it. Forget about the present—I didn’t get you one.
Birthdays are good for you. Statistics show that the people who have the most live the longest.
Birthdays are nature’s way of telling us to eat more cake.
I’d have definitely mailed you a card if I was going out for something I needed.
May your birthday be half as exciting as you portray it to be on social media.
Birthday, because I don’t give a shit if it’s Happy.
Happy Birthday! Try to forget that this day came about as a result of your parents having sex.
So many candles so little cake.
Congratulations on being a year closer to finding out if atheism was the right choice.
I’m so glad we’re going to grow old together and that you’ll always have a head start.
You know that that you are getting old, when you have to pay more for the candles than the cake itself.
You know everything about me and still decide to be my best friend…….. You are a deeply disturbed woman. You know that right? Happy Birthday
Looks 22. Feels 18. Acts 10. That makes you 50.
"You always have such fun birthdays; you should have one every year."
Happy Birthday—I’m glad you were the strongest sperm.
First you forget names, then faces, then you forget to pull your zipper up, then you forget to pull your zipper down.
To the nation’s best-kept secret: your true age.
At least when you’re alone on your birthday you can have the whole cake to yourself.
Happy Birthday. I hope your coworkers don’t use today as an excuse to give you inappropriately long hugs.
Happy Birthday! You should feel really special because I didn’t need a Facebook reminder to remember your Birthday.
Happy Birthday to one of the few people I can actually tolerate on a daily basis.
You’re only as old as the man you feel. Note to self: start dating younger men.
Just turned 35 years old…..again!
At least you’re not as old as you will be next year.
I know you had lots of Birthday wishes on your Birthday, but who’s thinking about you today? Me, that’s who. Happy Belated Birthday.
Your birthday is the perfect opportunity to remind you that my birthday is coming up soon.
Happy Birthday to the family member I’m least ashamed to be related to.
If you were Jesus today would be Christmas.
If I lived closer, I would almost definitely try to come to your birthday party.
Sorry an entire year still wasn’t enough time for me to buy you a birthday present.
I’m not making any age-related jokes because I genuinely feel bad about how old you are.
Happy Birthday to someone I think about almost as much as I think about myself.
The best way to remember your wife’s birthday is to forget once.
Age is just a number that determines how happy, attractive, and able-bodied you are.
I get awkward when someone compliments me and I don’t know what to say.
Them: You look pretty today.
Me: Happy Birthday.
You can only be young once but you can always be immature.
Don’t worry, I am right here by your side to help you mourn the death of your youth.
May you get as much praise and attention on your birthday as an average millennial feels entitled to every day.
Let’s celebrate the first time you cried naked in someone else’s bed.
Growing old is mandatory but growing up is optional.
At your age getting lucky means finding your parking spot.
I have prepared your birthday cake and then called the fire department to blow out the candles on your cake.
Two tips on your birthday:1. Forget the past—you can’t change it.2. Forget the present—I didn’t get you one.
I’m so sorry I forgot your birthday… but how do you expect me to remember your birthday when you never look any older?
Smart. Charming. Funny. But enough about me, Happy Birthday!
Forecast for your birthday: a strong chance of alcohol and poor decisions.
I bought you an awesome bottle of wine for your birthday! It tasted wonderful.
I hope you celebrate your birthday the way you came into this world… Naked and screaming.
Another year to prove that getting ‘older’ doesn’t necessarily mean getting ‘wiser’.
Allow me to suggest this be the year you start lying about your age.
I’d bake you a cake today if I knew how to use the oven.
I find it strange we celebrate you on the day your Mum did all the work.
Happy Birthday and may you live so long that no one wants to see you naked.
When I look at you, I can’t think of the worst part of getting older – because everything about it seems equally bad. Happy birthday.
I’m so sorry you’ve reached an age where pop culture marketers are no longer targeting you.
You know you’re getting old when you never walk past a bathroom without saying “well, I’m here already – I may as well pee.
Sorry you have to scroll so far down the menus on websites to choose your birth year.
On your birthday I’m going to share the secret to staying young: lying about your age.
I haven’t brought any cake for you. Because I know you love this bottle of champagne more.
I searched a long time to find the perfect birthday message for you, but just ended up with this.
Best friends are so awesome. Well, at least yours is. Happy Birthday.
God made us best friends because he knew our parents couldn’t handle us as sisters.
If you were stung by a jellyfish, I’d totally pee on you.
Whenever someone asks me who my best friend is, I immediately think of you. Hope your birthday is as amazing as you are!
Happy Birthday to a friend of a friend who I now like more than the original friend.
Best friends are supposed to share everything with each other, so I am celebrating and sharing your birthday with you like it’s my own.
I love you because we hate the same people.
Happy Birthday to my best friend. You know I will do anything for you, even if it means holding your hair back when you are puking.
You are charming, compassionate, intelligent and strong. The best thing is that you are also my best friend. Happy special day!
You drink too much. You swear too much. You have questionable morals. You’re everything I ever wanted in a friend.
You’re more beautiful than Cinderella, you smell like pine needles and your face is like sunshine.
Congrats on not becoming that crazy cat lady that stinks of piss.
Some people are blessed with a soul-deep friendship. Thank you for being my soul friend! I wish you a beautiful special day.
I love you like George R.R. Martin loves killing off characters.
We are just like fat thighs, we always stick together.
Congratulations.You are my favourite. And by favourite, I mean I hate you the least out of everyone.
I love you & your resting bitch face.
True friendship isn’t about being inseparable, it’s about being separated and nothing changes.
From you I have learned so much, including what friendship really means. I am so grateful for the day you were born.
Thanks for being born. It’s a great excuse for us to get together and get drunk.
I’m pretty sure we’re more than best friends. We’re like a really small gang.
I hope we are friends until we die. Then I hope we stay ghost friends and walk through walls and scare the shit out of people.
Keep calm and remember I love you.
Being friends as long as we have, people have started to say we look like alike. I can think of no greater compliment than to be called your sister, that’s for sure. Happy Birthday to my closest friend.
Side by side or far apart, best friends are always close to heart.
On your birthday, I’m reminded of your best quality: you’ll always be older than me.
Someday I want you to be my emergency contact person.
And IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII-e-IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII will always loveeeee youuuuuuuuuuuu.
Happy Birthday to the only person I know who is almost as awesome as I am. I know how hard it is to be humble.
Our laughs are limitless. Our memories are countless. Our friendship is endless.
Hey, it’s just me—wishing you a Happy Birthday because Facebook told me to.
Old enough to know better, young enough to do it anyway. Happy Birthday!
I want the whole world to know it’s my special friend’s birthday, which is why I’m inscribing long life and prosperity wishes on your wall, for everyone to see!
Happy Birthday ya filthy animal.
Happy Birthday to a person who is smart, good looking, funny, and reminds me a lot of myself.
Happy Birthday. See you on Snapchat for the Facebook-unfriendly party pics!
Congratulations on your new personal record for number of days lived.
Happy Birthday! But don’t thank me, thank my Facebook reminder…
Happy Birthday. Now, where’s the cake at?
Congratulations on being 1 year closer to having a 7pm bedtime.
Happy Birthday. And may the force be with you.
"ATTENTION EVERYONE: I have an important announcement to make on this special day; the birthday celebrant is a friend to hold and cherish forever, and I pledge my undying loyalty in front of you all, my witnesses from across the globe! Happy Birthday to a friend indeed."
Happy belated birthday. I didn’t forget…. I wanted to make it last longer.
Happy Anniversary of your daring womb escape!
I don’t remember adding you on Facebook, I don’t know who you are, but anyway—Happy Birthday!
Have the Best. Birthday. Ever.
Happy Birthday! And may your wall be filled with messages from people you never talk to.
If you get stumbling drunk tonight, please wrap yourself in bubble wrap, because people your age break more easily. Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to someone I care about enough to not ignore their birthday reminder on Facebook.
Sorry most of your birthday wishes on Facebook only contain one exclamation mark.
"I didn’t want to send you a birthday card because only you will get to see it. Instead, I chose to publish my best birthday wishes on your wall, so that the whole world can see it; The Best of Your Years are Still Ahead! Happy Birthday, dearest friend."
I hope you celebrate your birthday appropriately: wish lots of booze and bad decisions. Happy Birthday!
Congratulations on being born! You totally nailed it.
Your birthday it is, old you have become. — Yoda
Happy Birthday from one superstar to another!
Wishing you a Happy Early Birthday so I don’t have to remember it later.
Your birthday means so much to me that I’ve taken time out of doing nothing to send this.
Congratulations on being a year older and still maintaining such a low level of maturity.
I wish there was an even lazier way than social media to wish you a Happy Birthday.
Happy 24 hours of Constant Facebook Notifications Day.
Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday so I can get back to thinking about myself.
Happy Birthday, and may you grow so old that you unintentionally frighten small children.
Your birthday is the perfect opportunity to remind you and everyone on Facebook that my birthday is coming up soon.
Just wanted to be the first one to wish you a Happy Birthday so I can feel superior to your other well wishes.
I love you more than I love pizza.
You’re the missing piece to my jigsaw puzzle.
With each birthday, I love you even more.
You’re the reason for my smile.
I saw that you were perfect, so I loved you. But then I saw that you were not perfect, and I loved you even more.
Hey you. I love your face.
Words can’t explain what a wonderful person you are.
You make my heart melt.
My life has never been the same since I met you.
I would wait an eternity for you.
I can’t stop thinking about you.
You take my breath away.
Happy Birthday! I hope your day is as nice as your butt.
Every time I see you I get butterflies in my tummy.
You make my heart race without doing a thing.
I love your hugs and kisses.
You complete me.
I love you, forever and always.
Loving you is as natural as breathing.
I never knew what love was until I met you.
If I could rewrite the alphabet, I would put U and I together.
Thank you for taking such good care of my heart without knowing anything about cardiology.
Falling in love with you is the second best thing in the world because finding you was the first.
It’s big, it’s warm, and it’s fuzzy. Before you get any ideas – it’s a big HUG from me to you!
FYI: I love my man.
Do you love me? A: Yes B: A C: B
I love you more than I did yesterday but not more than I will tomorrow.
The path that leads to love is so narrow that two can’t walk on it unless they become one.
You’re cuter than a basket of puppies.
Wishing you miles of smiles for your birthday.
On your birthday, I just want to ask you one question. Why did you steal my heart? You know, I would have given it to you for free!
You not only mean the world to me. You are the world to me.
I never knew what love was until I met you. Happy Birthday.
Wishing a Happy Birthday to the man who is not only the perfect boyfriend, but a best friend as well.
Just remember: your birthday isn’t the only day where I will give you everything that you want. I will try to make that happen every single day of the year. Happy Birthday!
I hope you like the birthday present I got for you. Wait—I know you will!
I hope your birthday is as wonderful as you are.
You are the best boyfriend I’ve ever had and I hope you’ll be the last. Loving you always, Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday! Can’t wait to see you in your birthday suit tonight!!
Today I get to celebrate the one person that knows me better than anyone else and still chooses to love me. Thank you for your love and patience with me. I am so lucky to have you in my life.
Someone I love was born today.
I believe in destiny, I believe in fate… how else in the world would I have met someone like you. Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to the girl of my dreams.
Wishing you a day as unforgettable as I am—Whoops! I meant—as unforgettable as you are!
I would rather have you than my iPhone but I need my iPhone to take pictures of you. Happy Birthday.
Apart from wrapping you an awesome birthday gift, I am also going to wrap you in my arms.
As you blow out the candles on your cake, I want you to know there’s one flame that will never go out…. The one burning in my heart for you.
All I want in life is to be the reason for you to look forward to waking up every day with a smile.
We met as strangers, we hugged as friends, we kissed like lovers—this is one journey I never want to end.
My love for you is like a circle—it knows no beginning and never ends.
Happy Birthday to the luckiest loveliest husband in the world!
The secret to a happy marriage can be encapsulated in just four words – A Husband Like You. Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday! May you get all you wish for. Oh, wait…you already have all that you wish for… Me!
Happy Birthday to my Husband—I mean Hot Date for Life.
I had a life before I met you. But you’re the one who gave it meaning. Happy Birthday.
I fell in love with you, not because of what I found in you, but because of what you helped me find inside my heart. Happy Birthday.
For some reason when I go birthday shopping for you, I end up finding a lot more gifts for myself. Your birthdays are really expensive but you’re worth it.
Whoever said that all men were the same obviously never met you. Happy Birthday darling.
Happy Birthday to the love of my life and the biggest pain in my ass.
To the Best Husband in the world. You have made me everything I am, and let’s face it… I am totally fantastic.
Happy Birthday to the perfect wife who has made me the perfect husband that I am today.
I cannot imagine a life without you in it.
Not only are you a wonderful wife, you are my best friend. I love being able to grow old with you. Happy Birthday!
I said I would never discuss your age in any way, shape or form and I will always keep my promise. And to prove it, I married you when you were 23-years-old and this is the 18th birthday I have kept that promise. Happy Birthday Sweetheart!
Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife! You are first in my thoughts and first in my heart!
Most people read quotes to find the true meaning of life, but all I need to do is look into your eyes. Happy Birthday.
After many years of marriage and memories so sweet, even today when I see you my heart skips a beat. Happy Birthday Honey.
I would like to blink, however, I can never take my eyes off you even for just a second. Happy Birthday to my gorgeous wife, I love you!
My favourite place is inside your hug. Happy Birthday Baby!
Sisters like you are diamonds. They sparkle, they are priceless and they are truly a woman’s best friend. Happy Birthday sis.
Happy birthday to a lovely woman who is beautiful, intelligent and reminds me a lot of myself. I love you, sister!
Happy birthday to my favourite sister! Thank goodness you get less annoying as you get older. Just kidding. You’re the best!
Some people command respect, some admiration, some jealousy, some competitiveness and others, unconditional love. But you command all these things at once. Happy Birthday to my perfect sibling.
Sister, at times you could be the thorn in my side, the worm in my apple, and the pimple on my chin… but through thick and thin you will always be my sister! Happy Birthday to someone silly, spontaneous, beautiful, and witty! I love you to the moon and back!
Happy Birthday to my favourite sister. We are sisters by chance, friends by choice. A sister is a little piece of childhood that can’t ever be lost. Thanks for being there for me through the years.
Superheroes are One in a Million. Great sisters like you are One in a Lifetime. Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to a big sister that blazed the way for a path that is still on fire to this very day!
Family made us sisters, life made us friends. Here’s a great big birthday hug full of love and happy wishes as you celebrate your special day!
If only everyone had an amazing sister like you. The world would be a much better place. Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to Mum and Dad’s second favourite kid.
Happy Birthday to my favourite brother… okay, you’re my only brother, but if I had others, you’d still be my favourite.
They say you can choose your friends but not your family. I just want you to know that if we weren’t already brothers, I would choose to be friends with you in a heartbeat! I’m so lucky to have a brother like you! Happy Birthday!
I should call you Broogle because you help me solve all the problems to which I can’t find answers in Google. Happy Birthday Bro.
How could I forget all the times we got into trouble when we were growing up together? Or all the creative ways you helped me get out of trouble? Happy Birthday, bro, from your ‘partner in crime.’
Happy Birthday, Brother! Always know that if you fall… I will be the first one there to laugh at you!
Other kids look up to Superman, Batman and Spider-Man. I don’t need to look at a man flying in the sky, a capped crusader zipping along the streets or a guy jumping from one building to another. I just look up to you, my brother. Happy birthday to my superhero.
The best thing mum and dad have done is to give me a brother like you. Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! You smell like a donkey and you look like one too! Just kidding. You’re not an ass… all the time. Love, Your Favorite Sister
Thank you for my great childhood memories. Here’s to many more memories to come. Happy Birthday to the world’s greatest brother!
Birthdays are like chocolate. It’s best not to keep count of how many you have, and just enjoy them instead. Happy Birthday to the sweetest mother I know.
I’m not only celebrating your birth today. I’m celebrating my own luck in being born to such a great mother.
It’s amazing how good you look for your age, considering all the grief I gave you when I was younger. Happy Birthday Mum!
To a special mother on your birthday. You have taught me how to respect others, how to be kind, and most of all how to love. I hope your day is filled with all the wonderful blessings you have given to others throughout your life. Happy Birthday Mum!
Children may move out when they grow up, but they never stop needing their mothers. Thank you for always supporting me with love and compassion.
To the woman that always brought out the best in me or at least saw the best in me regardless of what I did. Happy Birthday.
Inspiration, friend, chef, chauffeur, advisor, role model, teacher, coach. You do it all for me. Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday Mum! Thank you for loving us all endlessly, for teaching us everything wonderful, for always being there no matter what any of us are going through and most of all. Thank you for our FAMILY.
Every day I wake up, I always have you to thank. I have your guidance, your warmth, your love, and your heart: someone who loves me unconditionally. Thank-you and Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday, Mum! I want you to know that I am nothing without you, but I can be everything with you by my side. Love you!
Thanks for letting me be my own man, even though you are the man that I wanted to be. Happy Birthday.
I put some money in a birthday card for you, but I am going to need it back after you open it. Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday to a guy who brings a new meaning to 50 shades of grey.
Dad, I know you’ve loved me as long as I’ve lived, but I’ve loved you my whole life.
I wonder if you know how much I love you. I sure don’t tell you enough. I love you and Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday Dad. No matter what life throws at you at least you don’t have ugly children.
Happy Birthday Dad! I would have gotten you a card with a really heartfelt saying on it but then we would have had to back-slap it out like men… no one needs to see that.
Love and laughter are the two best things you have given me. Thanks and Happy Birthday Dad!
Any man can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a Dad. Happy Birthday.
To the world, you may just be one person, but to me, you are the world. Happy Birthday Dad.
You are so little right now but you have brought unimaginably large amounts of happiness in our lives. Happy Birthday.
May your baby steps towards your birthday cake become your journey towards the best times in your life. Happy Birthday little one.
I wish you grow up to be smart, tough and wise. But I also hope that you always have the same innocence in your eyes. Happy First Birthday.
You are such a great person already. You always make people smile when they are around you. Happy 1st Birthday!
I hope you are always as happy and as carefree as you have been this first year of your life. Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday sweetheart! May all the days ahead be as happy as this, your very first birthday!
Your smile is priceless. Your hugs and kisses are therapy. You are perfect.
Eating with your hands is a privilege and duty at your age. Time to get down and dirty. Happy 1st Birthday!
You seem to have miraculous powers, little one. You can’t walk or talk but the entire household functions as per your demands. Happy Birthday.
We are wishing you unlimited happiness, hugs, and cuddles for your special day!
I wish you the courage to grab all the opportunities that will come by you
And I wish you the perseverance to live your life to the fullest.
Happy 18th birthday!
Good friends are hard to come by, lifelong friends are even harder. This friendship is forever whether it’s your 18th birthday or 100th, we’ll always be together.
Happy 18th birthday. Don’t start to take yourself too seriously. Nobody else is about to.
Life is a journey, and you’ve only just begun. Happy 18th!
Happy Birthday to someone who will now automatically be charged as an adult.
My advice to you on your 18th birthday is: don’t be afraid to make mistakes, to fall in love, or to ask for help. Also, save money (less fun but also very important.) Happy Birthday!
I can’t guarantee that your life after eighteen will be totally smooth. But as your friend, I guarantee that I will always stand by your side whether you are eighteen or eighty. Happy 18th birthday.
Happy Independence Day. Today, your life officially becomes a democracy as it receives freedom from the dictatorship of your parents. Happy 18th birthday.
You might think you’re old because you’ve turned 18, and that’s only because you still don’t know anything!
18 is one of the best ages. You get to do adult things while still acting like a kid, have fun!
Smile because you’re young and the future is yours to conquer. Happy 21st Birthday!
Happy 21st Birthday! Here’s wishing you health, wealth and happiness as you journey towards the rest of your life.
No one knows what the future holds. No one can change the past. The only thing you can control is your today. Live in the moment, your fun years have only begun. I wish you a wonderful and Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday! It’s been an amazing 21 years – watching you grow, learn, and laugh as you chase your dreams with the power to achieve anything.
The road ahead of you is filled with fantastic experiences and life-shaping memories. Make the most of them! Enjoy your 21st chapter to the fullest!
Happy Birthday!
Happy 21st Birthday. I cannot believe you are finally 21 years old! You have grown into such a beautiful/handsome young man/woman. I hope that you have the best birthday ever.
Welcome to adulthood! Now that you’re 21, I hope that you stay as carefree as before, yet more matured and responsible. Happy Birthday!
Just wanted to wish you a very special and Happy 21st Birthday. May you find faithful friends, precious memories, and happiness wherever life may lead you.
Take risks and be brave. This is the time of your life to make the mistakes you’ll regret later. Have a fantastic 21st birthday.
Wherever you go, whatever your decisions will be and whoever you will take with you on your life’s voyage, never forget that your family will stick by you no matter what! We love you and are so proud of you! Happy 21st birthday!
30 is three perfect 10s!!! Happy 30th.
Vintage 1987. A great year.
30 is a perfect age. You’re old enough to recognize your mistakes
but young enough to make some more. Happy Birthday!
20’s are probably a little overrated. 30’s are a lot more fun. Welcome to the fun decade.
30-year-old people are usually wise, stable, and responsible. Here’s to you making some positive changes as you get a little bit older. Happy Birthday!
It’s about time you start acting your age. Thirty is a good start.
You are not 30. You are just a 20-year-old guy with 10 years of experience. Happy Birthday.
Congratulations on turning 29 years old again for the second time. I’m looking forward to celebrating your 29th for many years to come.
Here’s to maturing like a fine wine. Happy 30th Birthday!
"“The only time you really live fully is from thirty to sixty. The young are slaves to dreams; the old servants of regrets. Only the middle-aged have all their five senses in the keeping of their wits.” — Hervey Allen"
Life is a book and your forties are the chapters when it all starts making sense. Wishing you an amazing 40th birthday!
Life’s milestones are not supposed to be counted, they’re supposed to be celebrated. Happy Birthday!
Wishing you a very Happy 40th Birthday. Enjoy your forties—they’re just like your twenties, but twice as good!
May your 40th birthday be an awesome mix of love, friendship, and happy memories! Wishing you a very Happy Birthday.
Finally 40! Now your life begins!
Here’s to being older and wiser than you once were, and giving all the best advice to young ‘uns who won’t listen. Happy 40th Birthday!
Spring chicken or not, you’re still the most fabulous hen I know! Here’s to having the energy of a pup, the senses of a deer, and the wisdom of an owl. Happy 40th Birthday!
Wishing you a very warm welcome to the middle ages. Happy 40th Birthday!
Forty is when you will finally realise why your mum and dad were so cranky when you were growing up. Happy Birthday.
Strive to be a 40-year-old that makes people go – ‘I wanna be like that when I turn forty.’ Happy Birthday.
Remember how excited you are when you turn 5 years old? You should be 10 times that excited. Happy 50th Birthday!
You are half a century, or 5 decades, or 50 years, or 600 months, or 2,609 weeks, or 18,262 days, or 438,288 hours, or 26,297280 minutes, or 1,577,836,800 seconds old, depending on what unit of measure you are using. Hey, at least I didn’t figure it out for seconds. Happy 50th Birthday!
The best way to enjoy life is to forget your age and just remember the memories. Happy Birthday.
If you take all the experience and judgment of men over fifty out of the world, there wouldn’t be enough left to run it.
Don’t let age dampen your youthful spirit. Life is a blessing, every day and every minute. Don’t be afraid of the wrinkles on your face. Every line is symbolic of one of your life’s phase. Happy 50th Birthday.
By the time we hit fifty, we have learned our hardest lessons. We have found out that only a few things are really important. We have learned to take life seriously, but never ourselves. I hope that any remaining lessons are fun!
A man who views the world the same at fifty as he did at twenty has wasted thirty years of his life.
You look 21, feel 18, and act 11. That makes you 50!
There are numerous advantages in being fifty. Just ask any eighty-year-old!
You’re no longer the oldest person I know in their 40’s. Now you’re the youngest 50-year-old I know.
You’re not getting older… just more distinguished! Happy 60th Birthday.
At 60, you have the combined wisdom of 6 10-year-olds, the intelligence of 3 20-year-olds, the wit of 2 30-year-olds, and the memory of 60 1-year-olds.
Happy 60th Birthday. Hope you continue to live life to the fullest — in good spirits, good health and good times.
Congratulations on turning 60. Now you can wear anything you want, and no one will care.
You leave everyone in awe. At 60, you have more going on in your life than most people have in a whole lifetime. You’re an inspiration to me and everyone who knows you! You leave us all wondering… what’s next for this fascinating person!?! You are awesome!! Happy 60th Birthday!
As we look back in your life, we realize that you have earned the most important things – the love of your family and the respect of your friends. Happy 60th Birthday.
Some may think of 60 as getting older, but it’s actually an amazing time in a person’s life where they can take stock of who they are and celebrate each new day with a renewed sense of self! Live life to the fullest! Happy Birthday!
You’re 60 years old? You’re 6 perfect 10s!
Happy Birthday.
It’s not that 60-year-old people are lazy: by 60, they’re masters at efficiency.
Every wrinkle has its story. You must have a lot of stories to tell. Happy 60th Birthday filled with lot of happiness and joy!
May your rocking chair always rock our world, may your walking stick always show us the right path, and may your spectacles always teach us to see right from wrong. Happy 70th Birthday!
Age can never catch up with a person who has already won the race of life. Happy 70th Birthday.
To be 70 years young is far more cheerful and hopeful than to be 40 years old.
Happy 70th Birthday! You deserve all the accolades you’re getting and more. You’ve worn so many hats for so many people, for so long — without expecting anything in return. It’s time you did!
At 70, there are two rules for making your birthday unforgettable: Rule 1: Have the time of your life. Rule 2: Don’t forget Rule 1.
Dream passionately as if you are in your youth, execute responsibly as if you are middle-aged and advice generously as if you are a seventy-year-old. Happy 70th!
I can only hope to be half-the person you are at 70 when I turn 35! Happy 70th Birthday.
One of the reasons why I love our family is that someone like you is part of it. Happy Birthday, Grandpa!
Whether you turn seventy or eighty, no matter how old you get, you will always be the hero dad who lifted his little daughter on his shoulder every time she tugged at his pants. I love you dad, Happy 70th Birthday.
You may have turned seventy, but your spirit makes you look twenty. Age is just a number in your life’s story, your soul will forever remain youthful and infectiously happy. Happy 70th Birthday.
The birthday wishes you sent to me was cuter than a kitty, sweeter than a puppy and more beautiful than a magnificent sunrise. Thanks.
Thanks for your wishes, they were… funny, cute and charming. Exactly like you.
Thank you guys. That was the best birthday wishes ever! You guys are amazing.
If your birthday wish was written on the image of a cake and pinned on Pinterest, it would go viral because it is the cutest thing I’ve ever read. Thanks for being such a sweetheart.
Nothing in this world is as beautiful as you are, except for the birthday wish that you sent to me. Thanks.
Thanks so much everyone for the astonishing birthday wishes.
Thanks for avoiding stock greetings from the supermarket shelves and taking the time to write such a beautiful handwritten message on my birthday card. You’re the best.
Gifts will wither away into the sands of time, but your words will reverberate in my heart forever, like a sweet little rhyme. Thanks.
Just like how a sprinkle of chocolate makes a coffee worth devouring, your heartfelt wishes made my birthday worth celebrating. Thank you so much.
From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank everyone for the birthday wishes and gifts . . . and for those who didn’t do anything, shame on you!
